conclusion:
my model1 use the sqft_living as X and get Mean Square Error 68351286833.039825
and model2 use the bathrooms as X and get Mean Square Error 97609006404.64667
i tried the other two columns but i got greater values than these two so the best x is sqft_living
and the second best is bathrooms and i think these two columns are related 
as sqft_living is large then the number of bathrooms is bigger and so on
